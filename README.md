Introduction
---

Welcome to the GitHub repository and project site for the MAXIS BlueZone Scripts! This project (formally kicked off in June 2014) aims to automate repetetive, error prone tasks using simple extensions to the BlueZone Mainframe Display system. These scripts do not contain any confidential data, nor do they contain information about how to log in to our various state systems. 

If you have questions about BlueZone Scripts and work in a Minnesota human services agency, please ask a supervisor about getting started.

State Administrators
---
As of June 2014, there is only one state administrator for the BlueZone Scripts project: 
* **[Veronica Cary](mailto:veronica.cary@state.mn.us)**: Project Manager and SNAP Data Analyst

In addition to our state administrators, numerous county/tribal agency personnel are involved in much of the writing and testing of BlueZone Scripts. Their contribution is appreciated!

GitHub workflow and organization
---

GitHub can be somewhat complex and daunting for beginners. For our organization, scripts are divided into two "branches":

* **MASTER**: the working directory for scriptwriters and select power users in scriptwriting agencies.
* **RELEASE**: the branch for most eligibility workers statewide.

Changes proposed here (assuming they "pass muster" with any policy/procedural folks involved at DHS) will first be merged into "master", then into "release" after **at least** a week of testing. **Scriptwriters (and a few select "power users" in each agency) are expected to work off of the master branch, and _contribute feedback_ throughout the month**. The recommended procedure is to give all master branch users access to both master and release versions of the scripts (using separate installations and "ZMD" configuration profiles). Agencies may stray from this procedure, but it is not recommended (as the master branch is the statewide "test" branch).

The newest/upcoming draft of release notes (upcoming changes that have already been built) is [located here](https://gist.github.com/theVKC/16fea8523efbb3df1917). Scriptwriters and power users are encouraged to "star" this document to get updates on the newest changes as soon as they are available for testing.

Issue list
---

We have an [issue list](https://github.com/MN-Script-Team/DHS-MAXIS-Scripts/issues) maintained on GitHub. Both scriptwriters and non-scriptwriters should feel free to create/report issues on the issue list (doing so requires a GitHub account). 

Scriptwriters are encouraged to tackle any issues on the issue list, so long as they meet the following conditions: 
* The scriptwriter has time in the near future to complete and test the issue (note that many issues have a "milestone", which may have an associated due date).
* The scriptwriter adds a comment to the issue saying they'll take it.
* The scriptwriter builds (or modifies) instructions on SIR after completing the work.
* For new scripts, the scriptwriter tests the new script on multiple cases/scenarios before submitting (ideally, for a week or so on active cases in their agency).
 
**ABSOLUTELY NO CLIENT DATA SHOULD EVER BE SHARED ON GITHUB.** In addition, please refrain from posting entire screenshots of system screens on GitHub issues. If case numbers or screenshots are needed, please share them via secure email (see your agency for your local process).

#### Issue guidelines/best practices
* Search existing issues before submitting a new one. Duplicates are annoying and add unneccessary work for administrators (as well as duplicate email notifications). It may also be wise to search through closed issues (by selecting "closed" in the top of the issue list).
* Issue title should be short (under 75 characters, or about the size of a case note header). This goes in the subject line for emails, so keep it clean.
* For existing scripts, please indicate the script category/name at the beginning of the issue (ex. "NOTES - CAF: needs longer space for 'other notes'"). This is helpful for organization.
* If there are multiple issues with an existing script, create separate issues for each. This is easier both for release notes tracking and for recipients of GitHub update emails.
* Don't upload screenshots of code, as it does not meet accessibility standards (and can't easily be copy/pasted). If you want to discuss code snippets, copy/paste them and surround them in blocks using GitHub markdown's default format (3 backticks: ```).
* If you have a question, it should only be posted if you believe a change to a script is necessary or wise. If it's a general scripts question, it is better addressed on the SIR discussion forum or via email.

#### Critical issues
Sometimes a bug or enhancement needs to be prioritized over other issues. We can mark those issues as "critical", which gets our attention. Here are the two situations in which a bug or enhancement is considered "critical":
* A script **in the release branch** has an inhibiting edit which is completely impassible.
* A script **in the release branch** is doing an action which has been (or will be) considered "incorrect policy".
 
_Please note_: script issues that only occur in the master branch are _not_ considered critical, as _the master branch is considered a test ground_. For this reason, **it is recommended that all master branch users also have access to the release branch**.

#### Script freezes
Script freezes are needed for making sure each new script, bug fix, and enhancement is properly tested. Generally speaking, enhancement/new script freezes are in effect in the following instances:
1. During the third week of each month (which corresponds roughly to the week before a script release).
2. When the issue list is over 40 issues (in this case, completing existing issues on the list is acceptable, so long as the first condition is respected).
3. For a few days prior to a major, project-wide update (such as a Functions Library update).

When there are over 40 issues, no new scripts or enhancements will be allowed on the GitHub issue list, unless they are critical from a policy standpoint (bug fixes are always welcome). Administrators may institute script freezes at other times dependent on need, and in these cases an email will be sent to scriptwriters.

Pull Requests
---
A "pull request" is the process of requesting that the script administrator "pull" your changes in to the main branch. The process of making a pull request is fully documented elsewhere.

#### Anatomy of a pull request

Pull requests, when done correctly, can automatically close issues and make changes easy for script administrators. As such, a strict format must be followed in order for your pull request to be accepted:

##### Title
A proper pull request first contains the issue it resolves. When the word "resolved" is the first word, followed immediately by the issue number, it will automatically close the corresponding issue when accepted. Immediately following this is a short (30-50 characters) explanation of what script this relates to, and what your change contains. 

For example: 

> Resolved #24601: readme contains correct link

If your pull request encompasses multiple issues, list them individually:

> Resolved #24601, Resolved #24602, Resolved #24603

**NOTE**: your pull request should typically only address a single script, unless a single issue spans multiple scripts.

Pull requests that deviate from this process might be rejected. If you make a mistake, you can always update the title of a pull request after you send it. This is an important process in order to maintain the integrity of our release notes and email/RSS notifications.

##### "The Blip"
It is important to summarize your update in a short "blip" for the release notes. _This should be written from a non-technical perspective_ that end users would understand.

A good blip example:

> The script has been updated to reflect the newest HEST standards effective October 2016. Some fields were also adjusted to accomodate the change in the dialog size.

A bad blip example:

> A function was broken. Replaced function with new

Note in the latter a lack of detail from an end user perspective (what did the new function fix?), as well as an incomplete sentence structure. To support the clear language goals of the department, the blip should be simple, clear, and concise. 

If a blip is missing or incomplete, your pull request might be rejected. Remember, you can always update an existing pull request if needed.

#### Pull Request Feedback
This is a collaborative project, and feedback on your pull requests is bound to come in from state and county/agency staff.

* Those who give feedback are expected to be considerate and respectful of the scriptwriter and their work.
* Scriptwriters receiving feedback are expected to incorporate suggestions or explain any disagreements/concerns (in a respectful manner).

We are working with people's creative output here. Disrespectful comments or unproductive suggestions will not be tolerated. But, suggestions to improve code readability, functionality, or consistency are expected to be followed (particularly coming from state administrators). Discussion is always welcome, so long as it's respectful.

#### When to wait on your pull request
If we are in a script freeze, particularly the week before a release, please refrain from pulling new work. The extra pull requests can clutter the GitHub lists and are sometimes challenging to clear if merge conflicts should arise.

#### What to do if there's a merge conflict
A "merge conflict" is a conflict in which one version of a file conflicts with another change. Perhaps you made a change at the same time someone else did? That's usually a pretty common reason for the conflict. Typically conflicts can be resolved in a few different ways:
* Compare each change against the most recent change to the file in the master branch. Sometimes it's really easy to tell where the conflict is when you look at the most recent change someone else made. If you suspect that's the issue, copy the new version into your change (within your branch), and see if that solves the problem.
* Try doing a pull request from the master branch to your branch (like a "reverse" pull request). This sometimes fixes issues.
* If you're using GitHub Desktop, try following the recommended "command line instructions" (which are included within the pull request).
* If all else fails, contact a state administrator and ask them! We're ready to help resolve these (but it might take a bit of time).

Scriptwriters and Hackathons
---
A typical (potential) BlueZone Scriptwriter has excellent critical thinking skills, is well organized, and reasonably computer savvy. Previous coding experience isn't required, but definitely helps. We use VBScript predominantly, run through the BlueZone Script Host (taking advantage of the custom functions that we've built, and the built-in custom functions of BlueZone). There are numerous online courses for VBScript and computer programming in general.

Trainings for BlueZone Scriptwriters are conducted on occasion. Contact a script administrator if you're interested in this.

BlueZone Scripts "hackathons" take place the 2nd and 4th Monday of each month. Any trained scriptwriter is permitted to attend with permission from their supervisor and state administrators. Contact a script administrator to find out more.

About the Functions Library (FuncLib)
---
The BlueZone Scripts "Functions Library" (or "FuncLib") is a centrally located repository for the common "shared functions" associated with MAXIS scripts. We use a separate repository for it, as it does not always follow the same release cycle as other scripts, and we want to keep the highly-technical conversation (and associated notifications) to a minimum for non-technical followers of our work. The FuncLib repository can be [found here](https://github.com/MN-Script-Team/BZS-FuncLib).

The "FuncLib block" is a block of code used within scripts that incorporates the shared Functions Library- this allows scriptwriters to take advantage of the dozens of functions used for navigation, case noting, autofill, and more. To use this library, simply add this block of code to the top of your script:
```
'LOADING FUNCTIONS LIBRARY FROM GITHUB REPOSITORY===========================================================================
IF IsEmpty(FuncLib_URL) = TRUE THEN	'Shouldn't load FuncLib if it already loaded once
	IF run_locally = FALSE or run_locally = "" THEN		'If the scripts are set to run locally, it skips this and uses an FSO below.
		IF use_master_branch = TRUE THEN			'If the default_directory is C:\DHS-MAXIS-Scripts\Script Files, you're probably a scriptwriter and should use the master branch.
			FuncLib_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MN-Script-Team/BZS-FuncLib/master/MASTER%20FUNCTIONS%20LIBRARY.vbs"
		Else																		'Everyone else should use the release branch.
			FuncLib_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MN-Script-Team/BZS-FuncLib/RELEASE/MASTER%20FUNCTIONS%20LIBRARY.vbs"
		End if
		SET req = CreateObject("Msxml2.XMLHttp.6.0")				'Creates an object to get a FuncLib_URL
		req.open "GET", FuncLib_URL, FALSE							'Attempts to open the FuncLib_URL
		req.send													'Sends request
		IF req.Status = 200 THEN									'200 means great success
			Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")	'Creates an FSO
			Execute req.responseText								'Executes the script code
		ELSE														'Error message, tells user to try to reach github.com, otherwise instructs to contact Veronica with details (and stops script).
			MsgBox 	"Something has gone wrong. The code stored on GitHub was not able to be reached." & vbCr &_
					vbCr & _
					"Before contacting Veronica Cary, please check to make sure you can load the main page at www.GitHub.com." & vbCr &_
					vbCr & _
					"If you can reach GitHub.com, but this script still does not work, ask an alpha user to contact Veronica Cary and provide the following information:" & vbCr &_
					vbTab & "- The name of the script you are running." & vbCr &_
					vbTab & "- Whether or not the script is ""erroring out"" for any other users." & vbCr &_
					vbTab & "- The name and email for an employee from your IT department," & vbCr & _
					vbTab & vbTab & "responsible for network issues." & vbCr &_
					vbTab & "- The URL indicated below (a screenshot should suffice)." & vbCr &_
					vbCr & _
					"Veronica will work with your IT department to try and solve this issue, if needed." & vbCr &_
					vbCr &_
					"URL: " & FuncLib_URL
					script_end_procedure("Script ended due to error connecting to GitHub.")
		END IF
	ELSE
		FuncLib_URL = "C:\BZS-FuncLib\MASTER FUNCTIONS LIBRARY.vbs"
		Set run_another_script_fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
		Set fso_command = run_another_script_fso.OpenTextFile(FuncLib_URL)

		fso_command.Close
		Execute text_from_the_other_script
	END IF
END IF

About the Installer/Configuration Utility
---
The BlueZone Scripts are "installed" (more like "configured" as they are simply script files inserted into a directory) using a utility written in VB.net and Windows Forms. This project requires Microsoft Visual Studio, and is considerably more technical than our other scripts. You can find the [repository for the installer utility here](https://github.com/MN-Script-Team/BlueZone-Scripts-Installer).
